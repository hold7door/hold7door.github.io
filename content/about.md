I am Arpit.  
I am currently working at SalaryBox where I work as a Backend Developer.

I can write code in - Python, Javascript and C++. 
Recently, I have been learning **Go**. Check out my github for some simple simulations I have been writing for fun alongside learning Go.

I am interested in distributed systems, networks, monitoring and observability (and a lot of various random stuff hard to list down).

When I am not in my tech zone, you can find me travelling, playing cricket / football / badminton / Table Tennis (yeah I like playing sports) or listening to music zoned out, or watching some weird underrated movies.
