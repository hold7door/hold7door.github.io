Constraints All elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
Solution On first look one can notice that it is easy to solve this problem in O(nlogn) time by first sorting the array and finding maximum difference between consecutive numbers.
Now think about if you were asked to solve this in O(n) time, where n is length of array</description></item><item><title>Kickstart Round G 2020 Combination Lock</title><link>https://hold7door.github.io/posts/post-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://hold7door.github.io/posts/post-1/</guid><description>This is a reiteration of the official Editorial supported with code. Link to Problem -Combination Lock. I would suggest you to read the original problem statement first before going through this editorial.
Problem Your are given an array of numbers of length W and an integer N. Each number of array, let&amp;rsquo;s say Wi is in range 1 &amp;lt;= Wi&amp;lt;= N. In one move you can select any number from the array and increase/decrease that number by 1, wrapping around between 1 and N.</description></item></channel></rss>
